## What You'll Find Here

This portfolio connects technical projects to the business outcomes they enable. It's indicative of how I approach the role of the technical seller within the wider context of the sales cycle: 

- **Understand the domain and challenges** to maximizing business value
- **Identify key requirements and practical value** of addressing the challenges
- **Clarify how you, in differentiated fashion, provide a solution** that meets the requirements
- **Prove the viability of the business case** as it pertains to the solution to be provided

**The projects below were built to make SEs more effective in clarifying the practical value and proving the viability of the business case.** 

Few things inspire confidence like tangeable examples. These projects provide tangeable examples.

## Projects

### Containerized Appium Testing Environment
**Repo:** [CommunityCode-AppiumCodeExamples](https://github.com/ddreakford/CommunityCode-AppiumCodeExamples)

A reusable, containerized testing environment to simplify running tests on mobile devices in the Digital.ai Testing Cloud. Built to eliminate the days of setup that SEs typically burn before they can demonstrate platform value.

- **30+ ready-to-run scenarios** covering basic through advanced capabilities (Android & iOS)
- **Containerized execution** (Docker/Docker Compose) — consistent environments, no local dependency headaches
- **Two-level parallel execution** for demonstrating enterprise-scale throughput
- **Integrated accessibility scanning** (axe DevTools / WCAG) and **performance instrumentation** (CPU, battery, memory, network)
- **Self-healing test capabilities** — tests adapt automatically when UI elements change between app versions

**SE Impact:** Reduced demo and POC setup from days to hours. Enabled multi-persona engagement across QA leads, engineering managers and compliance leaders in a single evaluation.

**Case Study:** [Testing Environment Impact](case-studies/testing-environment-impact.md)

**Tech:** Java, Python, Appium, TestNG, pytest, Gradle, Docker, Digital.ai Testing Cloud

### Mobile Application Security Assessment Framework
**Repo:** [mobile-app-assessment](https://github.com/ddreakford/mobile-app-assessment)

A toolkit to conduct mobile security assessments aligned to OWASP MASVS v2.0. Built to enable SEs who are not security SMEs to facilitate credible security conversations with CISOs and application security teams.

- **Complete assessment workflow** — decompilation, vulnerability hunting, MASVS-RESILIENCE analysis, professional reporting
- **AI-assisted workflow** reduces evaluations from 8-12 hours to 4-6 hours
- **CVSS v3.1 scoring** with professional report templates meeting enterprise governance expectations
- **Comparative analysis** tracks remediation effectiveness across app versions
- **Multi-audience deliverables** — technical reports, executive summaries, stakeholder email templates

**SE Impact:** Packaged security expertise into a repeatable process. Enabled security-focused discovery conversations that uncovered requirements often missed, and differentiated in technical evaluations through demonstrated "before and after remediation" comparison.

**Case Study:** [Security Assessment Framework](case-studies/security-assessment-framework.md)

**Tech:** JADX, APKTool, Python, Bash, OWASP MASVS v2.0, CVSS v3.1, Claude Code

## How I Think About Sales Engineering

I approach every technical investment through a lense of sales impact and force multiplication:

- **How will this facilitate selling conversations?** *Security assessment opened doors* with CISOs, security teams and developers. *Containerized testing environment highlighted the power and practical utility* of an enterprise grade, hosted test lab.
- **Will this shorten deal cycles?** If SEs spend less time on setup and more time on the customer conversation, deal velocity can be increased. The more expertise and best practice can be codified, the less bottlenecks we'll experience in scheduling and getting back to customers.
- **Will this improve win rates?** Full featured, use case oriented  demos and low-friction evaluations make a measurable difference.
- **Will this scale beyond me?** Community code, tutorials and containerized environments enable other SEs to benefit without needing to understand every implementation detail.

## Get in Touch

I'm open to conversations about Sales Engineering roles where technical depth and business impact are equally and highly valued.
